  \noindent We examine the short- and medium-term impacts of Uganda's 
  COVID-19 lockdowns on household food insecurity, labor market outcomes, and
  coping strategies, using longitudinal data.
  These severe lockdowns provide a unique case study for understanding 
  the implications of such public health measures on economic well-being. 
  Lockdowns significantly exacerbated food insecurity immediately and 
  continued to do so in the medium term. 
  The effect was more pronounced after the second lockdown, likely from 
  a combination of reduced resilience after the first lockdown and
  lower-than-normal rainfall immediately before.
  There were substantial decreases in income from various sources---including
  agriculture, non-farm businesses, and wage employment---contributing to the
  heightened food insecurity. 
  Notably, agricultural households were less adversely affected, and we find
  significant switching to agricultural activities as a coping mechanism. 
  The other coping mechanisms that households typically rely on for 
  idiosyncratic shocks, such as remittances and government assistance,
  failed, contributing to the sizeable increase in food insecurity.

# Introduction

Uganda had two of the strictest COVID-19 lockdowns in Sub-Saharan Africa, 
with the most severe parts of these lockdowns covering April through June 2020 
and June through July 2021 [@BBC2020;@Birner2021;@Mahmud2021].
As [@fig:raw-insecurity] shows, Uganda also experienced substantially higher food
insecurity during or immediately following these lockdowns than at any other time
during the pandemic.[^definition]
Using longitudinal household data, we aim to understand the extent to which
these changes arose from the twin lockdowns in Uganda by examining food insecurity, 
labor market outcomes, income changes, and how households attempted to cope with 
the lockdowns.

[^definition]: The definitions of the three levels of food insecurity are described 
in detail below [@FAO2015].

![Food insecurity by survey round of the Uganda high-frequency phone survey on 
COVID-19 together with severe lockdown periods shaded](../figures/food_insecurity_by_survey_round_3_levels.pdf){#fig:raw-insecurity}

To achieve this, we compare periods after severe lockdowns with other periods 
during COVID-19 where the restrictions were less severe.
The initial lockdown was initiated well before any substantial spread of COVID-19,
which allows us to isolate the effect of the first severe lockdown from the effect
of the spread of the disease itself.
The second lockdown illustrates the effects of a second aggregate shock, just as 
the economy was recovering.

Understanding how lockdowns impacted food insecurity and how households responded to them is relevant for three reasons.
First, it provides us with a way to learn about the effects of aggregate/covariate 
shocks and how households respond to them.
Second, households are still in the process of recovering from these shocks and 
likely will be for a substantial period, and this type of analysis 
can serve as a starting point for estimating the costs of the lockdowns.
Last but not least, understanding the cost and benefits of lockdowns is an important 
input into planning for future pandemics and the appropriate policy response to them 
[@World-Health-Organization2022].
The importance of this is illustrated by the September 2022 Ebola outbreak in Uganda,
which resulted in a two-month lockdown with travel restrictions in the affected 
districts [@Makerere-University-School-of-Statistics-and-Planning2023].[^ebola_literature]

[^ebola_literature]: Work on the effects of Ebola outbreaks shows
significant, and often long-lasting, impacts on food security and livelihoods in the
affected communities, across  Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Uganda, although 
separating out effects of the disease and the lockdowns is difficult
[@Langlay2014; @Kastelic2015; @Gatiso2018; @Djomaleu2022; @Makerere-University-School-of-Statistics-and-Planning2023]. 

Assessments in low- and lower-middle-income countries have found a mixed impact of lockdowns on 
food insecurity when identifying the effect through spatial or temporal variation 
in lockdowns.[^snapshots]
The Bangladeshi lockdown exacerbated food insecurity for urban low-income groups 
and in rural areas [@Hamadani2020; @Ruszczyk2021]. 
Households with mothers with very young children in Uttar Pradesh saw a sharp increase 
in food insecurity compared to pre-COVID-19 [@Nguyen2021a].
In Nigeria, higher COVID-19 case rates and lockdown measures increased food insecurity,
particularly for households relying on non-farm businesses and those in remote
and conflicted-affected zones [@Amare2021]. 
Similarly, in 14 refugee-hosting settlements and the associated host community in Uganda, 
lockdowns were associated with increased food insecurity and worsening diet 
quality, with refugees being more affected than hosts [@Squarcina2022].
However, in Ethiopia, Kenya, Liberia, and Malawi, there was no evidence of 
increased food insecurity with lockdowns 
[@Janssens2021; @Aggarwal2022; @Hirvonen2021].[^middle_income]

[^snapshots]: A large number of studies provide cross-sectional evidence on 
food insecurity prevalence during COVID-19 and how it varies with household
characteristics but do not attempt to identify the effects of lockdowns
[@Ceballos2020; @Ceballos2021; @Dasgupta2021; @Egger2022; @Gaitan-Rossi2021; 
@Giacoman2021; @Harris2020; @Jaacks2021; @Kansiime2021; 
@Kesar2021; @Kundu2021; @Lee2022]. 
Similarly, for income, employment, agricultural production, and savings
[@Balde2020; @Deshpande2020; @Egger2022; @Harris2020; 
@Jaacks2021; @Kang2021; @Kesar2021; @Komin2021; @Ronkko2022;
@Siwach2023].

[^middle_income]: In the middle-income countries of Chile, Guatemala, and Peru, 
lockdowns were all associated with increased food insecurity 
[@Ceballos2021a; @Curi-Quinto2021; @Giacoman2021].

There is more consensus on the negative effects on income and employment 
during the pandemic [@Schotte2023; @Mahmud2023].
This reduced income in the initial phases of the pandemic was associated with 
increased food insecurity in Uganda, particularly in rural areas [@Agamile2022].
Furthermore, there is evidence that households tried to cope with the 
pandemic and lockdowns and through behavior changes, such as 
reducing non-food expenditure, drawing down savings, leaving savings and loan
groups, increased borrowing, and selling assets 
[@Ceballos2020; @Kansiime2021; @Mahmud2023; @Ronkko2022; @Ruszczyk2021]. 
In addition, remittances declined, and there were insufficient or delayed
government support to help households cope with the shock 
[@Ceballos2021; @Curi-Quinto2021; @Suresh2022].

Our study contributes to two strands of the literature. 
First, we contribute to the literature on understanding the impacts of 
the lockdowns themselves.
Given the mixed findings and the limitations in data in the prior literature, 
we use household fixed-effects models on country-wide panel data to estimate 
short- and medium-run effects of lockdowns, with the goal of understanding the 
persistence of the impact of lockdowns in the months following their lifting. 

Second, we contribute to the small but growing body of research on the
effects of aggregate shocks and how households cope with these shocks,
which has mostly focused on financial shocks and natural disasters 
[@Del-Ninno2003; @Fallon2002; @Glewwe1998; @Hallegatte2020; @McKenzie2003; @Skoufias2003; @Thomas2007].
First, we examine a repeated systemic shock, of which the first instance was 
almost entirely unanticipated. 
Second, we directly analyze four broad categories of coping mechanisms 
that households may use to mitigate the effects of these shocks. 
The categories are changes in labor market participation,
diversification of income sources, transfers and remittances, and
changes in household structure through migration 
[@Foster2002; @Jayachandran2006; @Kochar1999; @McKenzie2003; @Morduch1995;
@Townsend1994; @Yang2007]. 
Our paper complements recent work showing that rural households in Uganda---especially 
non-farm business owners---experienced significant asset decline and increased 
likelihood of net borrowing, presumably as a coping mechanism after the first
lockdown [@Mahmud2023].

Compared to the prior literature, three things set our paper apart.
First, we use a nationwide representative longitudinal survey.
This is in contrast to much of the prior research, which is based on either very 
small samples [@Ruszczyk2021; @Squarcina2022; @Hirvonen2021; @Nguyen2021a] or
only rural areas [@Janssens2021; @Aggarwal2022].
Second, the data covers close to the entire pandemic, so we can observe 
the changes in food insecurity and household responses over time and through
multiple lockdowns.[^Nigeria]
Third, with very few COVID-19 cases in Uganda, especially for the first lockdown, 
we can separate the effects of COVID-19 from lockdown effects. 
However, there are at least three potential drawbacks to our approach.
First, phone surveys, as we use here, provide less detailed data about household 
members and may suffer from selection bias.
Second, in contrast to, for example, @Amare2021, we have limited  pre-COVID-19 
information on the households.
Third, there was no spatial variation in the lockdowns decreed by the government, 
opposite of, for example, Nigeria or India.
Hence, identification is based on comparing periods with varying degrees 
of restrictions, and our estimates are, therefore, likely lower-bound estimates. 

[^Nigeria]: The other study using nationwide representative data only cover
one survey round, April-May 2020, although more are planned [@Amare2021].

We find that food insecurity significantly increased during the lockdowns. 
The point estimates are significant, with an increase of almost 25 percentage 
points for any food insecurity during the first lockdown compared to the period
with no lockdowns. 
Even more concerning, moderate to severe and severe food insecurity
is more than 20 percentage points and almost 10 percentage points higher
relative to when there are fewer lockdown-related restrictions.

We also find that lockdowns have a substantial medium-term impact, with
any food insecurity about 10 percentage points higher two to three months after
the first lockdown was lifted. 
The medium-term impact was even higher following the second lockdown, 
with an approximately 20 percentage points increase three months after 
the second lockdown had been lifted. 
The differences in the medium-run impact between the two
lockdowns suggest that the lower-than-normal rainfall during July 
through October of 2021 compounded the negative effect of the lockdown.

To understand the mechanisms behind the significant impact on food
insecurity, we examine the effect on labor market outcomes and find
substantial decreases across all income types, such as wage income, 
agricultural income, non-farm business income, and income from assets owned. 
There were also substantial decreases in the likelihood of engaging 
in market work during the lockdowns.
Households in the agricultural sector saw lower increases in 
food insecurity than non-agricultural households, especially for
severe food insecurity, during the first severe lockdown.
This is consistent with agricultural households being able to
work even during lockdowns and have access to foods produced at home.

Furthermore, households attempted to cope with the lockdown by switching
to agricultural work, as shown by a significant increase in the
likelihood of working in agriculture after the first lockdown. 
However, likely because the concurrent rainfall shortfall made agriculture 
less attractive as a coping mechanism, there was no further
movement to agriculture after the second lockdown.

Traditional sources of support, such as remittance from abroad or
assistance from family members within the country, non-family
individuals, and development organizations, were all either flat
or decreased during the lockdowns. 
This suggests that the worldwide macroeconomic shock from
COVID-19 affected everyone's ability to transfer resources to needy
relatives or friends. 
This failure of the standard coping mechanisms is likely a 
significant factor in explaining lockdowns' substantial
effect on food insecurity. 


# Data

Household and individual data come from the *Uganda High-Frequency 
Phone Survey on COVID-19* (UHFS), conducted by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics in
collaboration with the World Bank. 
The survey was conducted in seven waves, with four waves in 2020 
(June, August, September, and October) and three in 2021 (February, 
March, and October). 
The goal was to understand the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 
pandemic by collecting high-frequency data on individuals and households 
[@Uganda-Bureau-of-Statistics2022]. 
To this end, the survey asked detailed
questions on food insecurity, employment, income, outside assistance,
and agricultural practices.

The UHFS sample is a subset of the 3,098 households interviewed in the
8th wave of the Uganda National Panel Survey in 2019/20 (UNPS 2019/20). 
In UNPS 2019/20, respondents were asked to provide a phone
number where they could be reached, either their own or that of a friend
or neighbor. 
Originally, the goal was to ensure households could be
reached in case they moved, but with the COVID-19 lockdowns, the phone
numbers became the basis for surveying households. Of the 2,386
households that provided a phone number, 2,225 were successfully
interviewed for Round 1 of the UHFS. The head of the household was
typically the respondent. If the household head was not present, another
member of the household over the age of 15 could respond to the survey.

A concern with phone surveys is that households with access to phones
are fundamentally different from households without access to phones. 
It is, for example, possible that phone surveys have a higher likelihood of
reaching wealthier households, who typically have better access to
phones, than poorer households. 
This would bias our results. 
To avoid any biases to the extent possible, we use the UHFS-provided survey
weights to ensure that the data is nationally representative 
[@Uganda-Bureau-of-Statistics2022].

Over the seven rounds, the cumulative attrition rate was 15.8 percent
of the originally surveyed households from Round 1,
with 1,873 households from the baseline interviewed in Round 7 (October 2021). 
However, replacement households were added to the sample
following the first round. 
This brings our total sample size to 2,334 households. 
The number of original households that remained in each
round together with the number of new households added in the follow-up
rounds and the total number of households per round are 
presented in Appendix Table \ref{tab:surveys}.

## Food Insecurity Measurement

The surveys measured food insecurity based on the Food Insecurity
Experience Scale (FIES) developed by the FAO [@FAO2016]. 
FIES uses eight questions with dichotomous (yes/no) responses to capture
different aspects of food insecurity. 
The questions are whether, during the last 30 days, there was a time 
when any adult in the household experienced the following because of 
lack of money or other resources: 
(i) were worried about not having enough food to eat; 
(ii) were unable to eat healthy and nutritious/preferred foods; 
(iii) ate only a few kinds of foods; 
(iv) had to skip a meal; 
(v) ate less than you thought you should; 
(vi) ran out of food; 
(vii) were hungry, but did not eat; 
and (viii) went without eating for a whole day. 

We follow the prior literature and calculate three food insecurity measure 
based on the sum of the eight food insecurity questions:
any, moderate or severe, and severe food insecurity 
[@Kansiime2021;@Wambogo2018;@FAO2016].
"Any" corresponds to having answered yes to any of the questions, 
"moderate or severe" to having answered yes to four or more, 
and "severe" if answered yes to seven or eight questions 
[@FAO2015;@FAO2016].[^individual_questions]

[^individual_questions]: Results for the estimations below using
each individual question as the dependent variable are available 
upon request.

Although the sample for the UHFS is based on the UNPS 2019/20, there is, unfortunately, 
no direct way to compare food insecurity across the surveys.
First, 
the UNPS 2019/20 questions have a broader scope, which includes situations 
such as insecurity in reaching the market, the absence of food in the market, 
and floods, rather than the lack of money or other resources in the FIES questions.
Second, 
the only food security-related question in UNPS 2019/20 asked whether 
there has been a situation in the last 12 months when there was not enough food 
to feed the household, with a follow-up question about which months this happened in
and an open-ended question about why it happened.
These do not match up with any of the individual FIES questions or the cumulative
food insecurity measures that we use.
Finally, the UHFS questionnaire asks about the respondent and other adults 
in the household, rather than the entire household as in UNPS 2019/20. 
As long as children are kept fed even in times of food insecurity, this does
not in itself prevent comparison, but it is possible that food goes to the 
most productive members of the household in order to preserve his or her 
productivity [@Pitt1990].[^months]

[^months]: A minor point of difference is that the UNPS 2019/20 asks about 
individual months, whereas the UHFS asks about the last 30 days before 
the interview, which, depending on when the survey took place, does not line up 
with the month-centric question of the UNPS 2019/20.



# Lockdown Context and Enforcement

On March 18, 2020, the Ugandan government began imposing restrictions,
including travel restrictions and cancellation of public gatherings,
such as religious services, weddings, and music events 
[@Uganda-Bureau-of-Statistics2022]. 
On March 20, schools were closed, and a total lockdown was imposed on March 30 
with a nationwide curfew from 7 pm to 6:30 am, banning of public
transportation, strict regulations on the movement of vehicles, and
closure of all non-essential businesses, which extended till the end of May 
[@Alfonsi2021; @Margini2020].

Lockdowns were eased at the beginning of June 2020 with the resumption
of public transportation and the opening of businesses 
[@Guloba2021; @Monitor2020; @Schwartz2021; @Wagner2022]. 
Most small and medium businesses were back open by July-August 2020 
[@Alfonsi2021]. 
International travel restrictions remained until the end
of September, when land borders reopened, and international flights
resumed [@Guloba2021].

In response to the increasing number of COVID-19 infections in 2021, the
government of Uganda imposed a second severe lockdown from mid-June 2021 
[@Atamanov2022; @Athumani2021]. 
This second lockdown was partly eased by the end of July 2021 [@Biryabarema2021].

To show the strictness of the lockdowns imposed, we employ a modified version
of the lockdown stringency index developed at the Blavatnik School of
Government, University of Oxford (Hale et al., 2021). 
The original index is a daily composite measure of how strict the lockdowns 
were based on nine indicators, including school closures, workplace closures, and
travel bans, rescaled to a value from 0 to 100, where 100 is the
strictest response. 
As some of the restrictions in the original index, such as school closure 
and international entry restrictions, are likely to have minimal immediate 
impacts on food insecurity, we recalculate the index using workplace 
closings, limits on public transport, stay-at-home requirements, 
and any restrictions on internal movement. 

The stringency index cannot capture the extent to which the lockdown 
policies were enforced or adhered to, and we, therefore, also use Google 
Mobility data on the percentage change in the number of 
visitors to retail and recreation locations relative to the pre-COVID-19
behavior [@Google2022].
We use this measure because it captures the closures of shops and has 
better regional coverage than most other mobility measures.[^other_mobility]
Each day of the week is scaled relative to a "baseline day," which
is the median value from the five weeks, January 3 -- February 6, 2020. 

[^other_mobility]: Mobility information for the five other locations types, 
    the percentage change in the number of visitors to workplaces 
    to groceries or pharmacies, to transit stations, to parks, 
    and the percentage change in the time spent at residential locations are 
    shown in Appendix Figures @fig:mobility_national_workplaces 
    through @fig:mobility_national_residential.
    The visits to workplaces measure also has good regional coverage
    but it is unclear how relevant this is given that the majority of 
    people in Uganda work in agriculture.
    
![Revised stringency index, visits to retail and recreation locations, daily new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons and new deaths per 100,000,
and data collection window for each UHFS survey round](../figures/combined.pdf){#fig:combined}

[@fig:combined] shows the daily stringency index, the daily Google Mobility measure,
the 7-day average number of new COVID-19 cases and deaths per 100,000 persons, 
and the data collection window for each of the UHFS rounds in shaded grey. 
The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths comes from "Our World in Data."[^4]

[^4]: The advantage of using "Our World in Data" is that it collects
    available COVID-19 data from many sources. The data are available
    atÂ <https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv>, and
    a complete listing of underlying sources is
    atÂ <https://github.com/owid/COVID-19-data/tree/master/public/data/owid-covid-codebook.csv>.


The strictest restrictions are just before Round 1, where there is an almost
complete lockdown. 
According to the stringency measure, the second lockdown---in June and July 2021---was 
nearly as strict as the first. 
Furthermore, the four months after each lockdown show similar stringency levels.

That the most severe lockdown policies were enforced is evident from the 
substantial decreases in visits to retail from April through June 2020 
and June through August 2021, with close to 75% and 50% decreases, respectively.
Despite the remaining restrictions during the second and third rounds,
the number of visits to retail locations slowly improved, stabilizing at around
25% below "normal" during the 4th through 6th survey rounds.
Only around May/June 2021 had retail visits returned to almost the baseline level.

Outside of the severe lockdown periods, the time spent at home remained
relatively stable with three notable exceptions.
The two most innocuous are the closures around the Christmas and New Year's celebrations.
The third is the 2021 general election, which took place on 14 January.
All shops were closed on the day of the election, and nobody appeared to have 
gone to any retail location immediately following the election.
Although the election was preceded by widespread violence and internet shutdowns 
immediately around the time of the election, the reduction in visits to retail 
and recreation locations appeared to have been relatively short-lived.

The number of confirmed infections and deaths from COVID-19 remained low in
Uganda until halfway through 2021. 
For context, even with the spike in cases in 2021, Uganda's cumulative 
number of cases per 100,000 at the end of 2021 was only 306.9 compared 
with 16,294.5 in the US.
Furthermore, as in many other developing countries, the number of COVID-19 deaths was low.
Even with the increase in cases and deaths by the end of 2021, Uganda 
had only 7.2 deaths per 100,000 persons, while, for
comparison, the US had 245.1 deaths per 100,000 persons.

On top of lockdowns and COVID-19, the later part of 2021 saw a below-normal
rainfall during the rainy season across the country.
The three-month 3-month rainfall was 75% of normal when averaged across 
all measurement stations, and all stations showed a below-normal three-month 
rainfall in August 2021.[^subnational_rainfall]

# Estimation Strategy

To examine the effects of COVID-19 lockdowns, we use household
fixed-effects models on a nationally representative longitudinal
household data set, relying on the changes over time in
government-imposed lockdowns to identify the effect.

Our main specification regresses outcomes, $Y$, on a
set of variables using a linear fixed-effects model:[^linear_advantages]

$$
Y_{i,t} =  \sum_{t=1}^7 \beta_t 1[Round = t]  + \gamma Cases_{t} 
+ \omega_i + \epsilon_{i,t}, 
$$

where $i$ denote household and $t$ survey rounds. 
All standard errors control for clustering at the primary sample unit
level.

[^linear_advantages]: A linear model has two advantages over non-linear models, such as
conditional logit, and has often been used in recent studies 
[@Alam2020; @Alam2018; @Charles2008]. 
First, coefficients are easier to interpret. 
Second, a linear model allows a more straightforward comparison of 
coefficients across regression where some dependent variables 
are binary and some non-binary.
Robustness checks, available upon request, show that
conditional logit models lead to similar results.


We use survey indicator variables to capture the variation over time.
The first survey round took place between 9 and 27 days after the
end of the first severe lockdown and, therefore, can be thought of
as capturing the short-run effect of the first lockdown.
The second survey took place 63 to 86 days after the first lockdown ended
and the seventh survey took place 74 to 105 days (with the majority within 
87 days) after the second lockdown ended.
These we refer to as medium-term.
The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth survey rounds took place
112--130, 155--176, 253--272, and 281--322 days after the
first severe lockdown.
We use the fourth survey round as the excluded round because it is
the survey round furthest from both lockdowns and before any substantial
number of COVID-19 cases, and before the general election begins in earnest.

In addition to government-imposed lockdowns, individuals may be ill,
decide to self-isolate, or take other steps to avoid contact with others
if they perceive a high risk of contracting COVID-19, which may increase
food insecurity. 
To capture the severity of the COVID-19 situation, the $Cases$ variable 
measures the number of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000
persons in the 30 days before the household's survey date.
Unfortunately, there is no information available on the number of COVID-19 cases
at a more granular level than the country level.



Although we do not include any household-level variables in the 
model, there are still three advantages to using a fixed effects model.
First, 
the fixed effects estimates are more conservative than pooled OLS in the 
sense that fixed effects models have a lower likelihood of type I errors and
potential attenuation bias toward zero with classical measurement error.
Second, 
fixed effects models are more robust to measurement errors that vary 
systematically across individuals than pooled OLS.
For certain food insecurity questions, such as, for example, those that refer to 
healthy food, the diversity of foods available, and eating less than desired, 
there may be individual-specific threshold levels.
The within-household fixed effects model reduces the potential bias from 
this type of measurement error because it relies only on within-household 
variation. 
Finally, 
the household fixed-effects, $\omega_i$, control for time-invariant 
characteristics associated with the individual/household, 
such as gender, race and religion, constant preferences, household 
characteristics, and area characteristics, thereby absorbing the variability 
in the dependent variable due to household-specific characteristics 
and reducing the residual variance. 
This reduction in residual variance can lead to more precise estimates.
For some estimations, we use individual-level dependent variables, like
employment. 
In these cases, the models are individual fixed-effects models, as the 
same individual from the household is followed over the rounds.

In summary, we identify the impact of Uganda's lockdowns by comparing
periods with more or less severe lockdowns, while the individual
survey round indicators capture other potential factors that might impact 
food insecurity, 
such as seasonality and the unrest in connection with the 2021 general elections.
Especially the first lockdown is of interest because it came at a 
time when there were close to no COVID-19 cases, and, in fact, there
was no substantial spread of COVID-19 until well after the first 
severe lockdown ended.
Hence, we can identify the effect of the lockdown as opposed to 
the aggregate effect of the lockdowns and the spread of the disease
combined.

To ensure that we are not capturing other changes, we also 
examine the potential role of seasonality in the results. 
Finally, there were no official variations in lockdown policies
or enforcement across different areas, and we, therefore, cannot 
rely on spatial variation for identification.
Instead, we examine differences in mobility patterns and food insecurity
across regions.


# Did Lockdowns Increase Food Insecurity?

![Estimated changes in food insecurity with 95% confidence intervals by survey round relative to Round 4, 
controlling for number of COVID-19 cases and household fixed effects](../figures/food_insecurity_survey.pdf){#fig:food_insecurity_survey}

[@fig:food_insecurity_survey] shows the estimated changes in the
three food insecurity measures by survey round, relative to 
survey Round 4, together with the 95% confidence intervals for 
a linear model with household fixed effects.[^base_results]
Overall, COVID-19 lockdowns appear to be associated with substantial 
increases in all levels of food insecurity.

[^base_results]: The full tables for this and all following
results presented as tables are available upon request.

Approximately a month after the end of the first severe lockdown, 
the proportion of households that report any or moderate to severe food 
insecurity is more than 20 percentage points higher than in Round 4,
an effect that is statistically significant. 
Severe food insecurity in Round 1 is just below 10 percentage points 
higher than in Round 4 and also statistically significantly different 
from Round 4.

About three months after the end of the first severe lockdown, 
any and moderate to severe food insecurity levels are still statistically 
significantly higher than in Round 4 at approximately 10 percentage points.
Severe food insecurity is also increased but not statistically significantly
so.

Between six and eleven months (Rounds 3 through 6), there is little 
discernable difference in the levels of food insecurity, and we cannot 
reject that they all have the same levels. 

The final round, Round 7, took place 2.5 to 3.5 months after the end
of the second major lockdown, but in relation to Round 4, the levels of
food insecurity are closer to those of Round 1.
Any and moderate to severe food insecurity are both more than 20 percentage 
points higher than in Round 4, while severe food insecurity is more than 10
percentage points higher; all three are strongly statistically significant.
These medium-term effects are close to the short-run effect of the first severe lockdown.


## The Role of Seasonality

Uganda has two lean seasons, one in April and May and another
in November and December [@FAO2022]. 
Hence, with the first survey round
fielded in June 2020, it is possible that part of what we capture with
the Round 1 indicator variable is the effect of the April/May lean
season on food security. To examine the role of seasonal variation, we
compare the changes in food insecurity measures with the closest
comparable from previous rounds of UNPS 2019/20 and estimate our main model on
alternative samples to show that seasonal variation is unlikely to
explain our results.


To examine whether seasonality in food security might be behind our
results, we first compare pre-COVID-19 information on food insecurity with
a subset of our measures. 
The UNPS 2015/16 and the UNPS 2019/20 both asked if the households had been 
faced with a situation when they did not have enough food to feed the 
household in the last 12 months. 
If yes, they were asked to list all months when this occurred. 
Although this question does not directly correspond to any of the food insecurity
questions asked in the UHFS and the recall period is one year rather
than the 30 days for the UHFS, it is close to three of our questions:
ran out of food because of lack of money, went hungry but did not eat,
and went without eating for a whole day.

For the UNPS question, we combined all observations from 2015/16 and 2019/20 
by month, and calculated the percentage who reported not having enough food 
to feed the household. 
For the UHFS questions, we calculate the percentages of food insecure by interview 
month. 
[@fig:seasonality] shows the food insecurity percentages with the UNPS question 
shown in black for comparison.
Despite FAO listing April/May and November/December as the lean periods,
the UNPS data show that April, May, and June were the three months with
the highest proportion of food insecurity, while November and December
were the months with the lowest proportion.[^13]

[^13]: This pattern holds for both UNPS 2015/16 and UNPS 2019/20. The
results for the individual surveys are available upon request. 
UNPS 2018/19 shows the same questions in the questionnaire, but the
responses are not available in the data.



![Projected seasonality in food insecurity from UNPS and observed food insecurity for three UHFS 
outcomes](../figures/seasonality.pdf){#fig:seasonality}

All three UHFS questions follow the same general pattern as the UNPS
question outside the lockdown periods, September 2020 through April 2021,
while the months following the lockdowns are clearly elevated. 
Although it is possible that these high values were the result of seasonal 
variation, we consider it unlikely for two reasons. 
First, there is no evidence of the same elevation for April 2021, which 
is also in the lean season but nine months after the lockdown. 
Second, the medium-term effects of the second lockdown show even 
worse medium-term food insecurity outcomes despite being in a non-lean period.

Our second approach is to re-estimate our main models on three subsets
of the data. 
First, we make use of the fact that Round 6 took place during the April/May 
lean season but was the round least affected by lockdowns.
Because Rounds 1 and 2 also took place during the lean season, we  
estimate our main model using only information from Rounds 1, 2, and 6. 
The results are shown in the top panel of Appendix [@fig:seasonality_comparison]. 
Compared to the main model, the short-run effects are slightly smaller 
and the medium effect larger. 

Second, to show the robustness of the second lockdown medium-run results, 
we make use of the fact that Rounds 4 and 7 were collected during almost the
same calendar month.
The bottom panel of Appendix [@fig:seasonality_comparison] shows the
results when we restrict to those two rounds. 
The medium-run effect of the second lockdown for this sample is smaller 
but still statistically significant in most cases. 
Complicating this comparison is that the number of new COVID-19 cases was close 
to constant within each round and smaller during Round 7 than Round 4, 
resulting in potential multicollinearity and statistically significant 
*negative* effects of new cases on food insecurity for some outcomes. 

Finally, we expect urban households to be less affected by seasonality, 
and Appendix [@fig:seasonality_urban], therefore, shows the results using 
only urban households across all rounds. 
The short- and medium-run effects of the lockdowns are either
the same or larger when we restrict the sample to urban households.
Hence, our results are qualitatively the same, no matter how we account
for seasonality.



## Regional Variation 

All of the results above are national-level, which may obscure critical
regional variations in COVID-19 exposure and the degrees and effects of lockdowns.
This section, therefore, examines differences in the Google Mobility measure and 
in food insecurity across the survey rounds for each of the four regions in Uganda.

Uganda is divided into four regions, Central, Eastern, Northern, 
and Western, which, although without direct administrative roles, are
used as units for statistical and planning purposes.
The regions have approximately the same population size, except for the Northern
region, which had 20% of the population in the 2014 census.

The Central region is home to Kampala and the most urbanized,
with the four most populous urban centers in Uganda 
[@Uganda-Bureau-of-Statistics2016].
Combined, these four urban centers are home to one-third of the
entire urban population of Uganda, with almost 2.5 million people.[^small_urban]
The region has a higher concentration of service and industrial employment 
than the other regions and the lowest poverty rates [@Ssewanyana2012]. 

[^small_urban]:
For comparison, the fifth-largest urban center, the Western region's Mbarara, 
had fewer than 200,000 people in 2014.

In contrast, employment in the other regions is predominantly agricultural. 
The Eastern region is characterized by mixed farming, including both crop 
cultivation and livestock, with a focus on cash crops like coffee and tea. 
The Western region, rich in fertile soils and rainfall, supports intensive 
agriculture, particularly dairy farming and tea cultivation. 
The Northern region, historically affected by conflict, has a more 
subsistence-oriented agricultural system, with lower levels of productivity 
and a slower pace of urbanization, and consistently has the highest poverty levels.  


![Regional distribution of percentage changes in the number of 
visitors to retail and recreation locations](../figures/mobility_regional_retail.pdf){#fig:retail_regional}

[@fig:retail_regional] shows the percentage changes in visits to retail and
recreation locations by region, together with the survey rounds.[^appendix_regional]
In all regions, there is clear evidence of the scale of the first severe lockdown,
although the percentage change is larger in the Central region at about 75%,
compared with just over 50% in the other three regions.

[^appendix_regional]: Appendix @fig:mobility_regional_workplaces
through Appendix @fig:mobility_regional_residential 
show the percentage changes in the number of visitors to workplaces 
to groceries or pharmacies, to transit stations, to parks, 
and the percentage change in the time spent at residential locations.
Although the workplace mobility data appear to have broader coverage we 
prefer the retail measure because of the predominately agricultural nature
of work in the Eastern, Northern, and Western regions.

During the second severe lockdown, there is a smaller reduction in the visits to
retail locations than the first, but otherwise, it followed close to the same regional 
pattern as the first lockdown.
The Central region showed the largest reduction at around 50%.
The Western and Eastern regions both saw approximately 40% reductions when 
compared to the period immediately preceding the second main lockdown.
The data for the Northern region is spottier, but there is some evidence
for a reduction in visits compared to the period immediately before the
second lockdown.

These changes in visits to retail locations are consistent with more heavily 
enforced lockdowns in urban than in rural areas.
However, even in the three more agricultural-focused regions, there are substantial 
changes in mobility consistent with enforced lockdowns. 
For the second lockdown, it is possible that part of the change
in behavior comes from self-isolation associated with the increasing number 
of COVID-19 cases, although, unfortunately, no regional data is available to
investigate this possibility.[^regional_covid]

[^regional_covid]: While we normally think of cities as having a higher communicable disease load 
than rural areas, this might not hold in the case of COVID-19. 
Rather, larger rural households may allow more people to be exposed to 
COVID-19 infections, especially if lockdowns are enforced in rural areas.
Furthermore, people may be moving from urban to rural areas to "escape" 
increasing levels of COVID-19 infections, bringing COVID-19 with them to rural areas.

[@fig:food_insecurity_region] shows the results by level of food insecurity
and regions, where each region is treated as a separate sample.
The regional raw levels of food insecurity by round are shown in 
Appendix [@fig:region_descriptive].
Because we do not have information on regional COVID-19
cases, all models are estimated without COVID-19 cases variables.

![Estimated changes in food insecurity with 95% confidence intervals for each region by survey round relative to Round 4, controlling for household fixed effects](../figures/food_insecurity_region.pdf){#fig:food_insecurity_region}

Both the Central and Eastern regions follow a pattern very closely 
aligned with the national-level results.
All three levels of food insecurity are statistically significantly
higher in the immediate aftermath of the first lockdown compared to 
Round 4, and food insecurity gradually decrease for the next two 
survey rounds.
The levels remain approximately constant until after the second
lockdown, where food insecurity levels in Round 7 are all statistically 
significantly higher than in Round 4.

For the Northern region, severe food insecurity follows the national level pattern.
However, for moderate/severe food insecurity, only Round 5 is not
statistically significantly different from Round 4, and levels in 
Rounds 1 and 7 are more than 40 and 30 percentage points higher,
respectively, than Round 4.
Furthermore, although the changes in any food insecurity are closer 
to the national-level changes, they are generally smaller.

The Western region is the region that stands out most compared to the
other regions. 
First, there is little to no change in severe food insecurity, except
for the last survey round, which is just below 10 percentage points
higher than Round 4.
Similarly, although Rounds 1 and 2 for moderate food insecurity are 
statistically significantly higher than Round 4, the effects are smaller than 
elsewhere.
For any food insecurity, the Round 7 level is substantially larger
than any of the others, despite Round 7 further away from the end
of the lockdowns than Rounds 1 and 2.

What do these regional results tell us about the relative effects of the 
lockdowns?
There are likely two conflicting dynamics at play here.
On one hand, urbanized areas can more effectively enforce lockdowns, as 
shown by the mobility measure for the Central region.
On the other hand, proximity to the poverty line greatly increases 
vulnerability to food insecurity. 
This latter point is crucial, as even minimal enforcement measures in 
poorer regions like the Eastern region can precipitate significant 
shifts into food insecurity, due to the already precarious economic 
standing of these households. 
This is mirrored in the Northern region, where, in addition, the high 
baseline poverty levels mean that the observed changes in food insecurity 
are less pronounced over time---the level of any food insecurity never got 
below nearly 70% of the population at its best.

Finally, the Western region contributed  significantly to the high 
national-level Round 7 results.
Part of this is likely the effect of an even more prolonged period of 
below-normal rainfall than the other regions.
Using the Round 2 results as the basis, it appears that about half
of the increase in Round 7 food insecurity is due to the below-normal
rainfall, and the other half is due to the second severe lockdown,
likely combined with the cumulative impact of sustained lower-level
lockdowns in between the most severe lockdowns. 

## The Role of Attrition 

As discussed above, almost 16% of the original households 
surveyed in Round 1 failed to respond by Round 7.
Although new households are added, a concern is whether the
attrition of households is non-random and might bias the result.
To examine how sensitive our results are to attrition, we 
perform a bounding exercise, where we either assume that all
households that fail to respond would have been food insecure
or that they would not have been food insecure.[^thank_eric]

[^thank_eric]: We would like to thank the Editor for this 
suggestion.

![Food insecurity estimates when assuming that all missing households are
either food insecure or are not food insecure](../figures/food_insecurity_survey_attrition_combined.pdf){#fig:attrition}

[@fig:attrition] shows the results for the nation-wide bounding estimations
together with the original results.
For the any and moderate or severe food insecurity outcomes, whether we assume 
that attrited households would have been food insecure or food secure, 
those results that were statistically significant in the main model remain 
statistically significant for the bounding exercise.
The main potential change in the results is for severe food insecurity in Round 1, 
where the first round is no longer statistically significantly different from
Round 4, if we assume that attrition households would have been severely food insecure,
although we cannot reject that the Round 1 coefficients are the same across the
original and the two bounding assumptions.
Furthermore, if we assume severe food insecurity for missing households 
the Round 7 estimate is statistically significantly larger than both the original 
estimate and the estimate if we assumed that attrited households were not 
severely food insecure.


# How Households Responded


To understand how the government lockdowns affected food insecurity and
how households responded to the lockdowns, we examine four
categories: labor market outcomes, movement between sectors, 
changes in income across sources, and
assistance from outside sources.

## Impact on Labor Market Outcomes

Lockdowns may affect the availability of employment, both because
workplaces close and because of the overall reduction in economic
activity likely to follow lockdowns. Respondents were asked whether they
did "any work for pay, any kind of business, farming or other activity
to generate income" in the last week. If yes, they were asked whether
this was the same job as the previous round and the broad industry in
which they worked in the current survey round. For Round 1, respondents
were also asked whether they did the same work as before the pandemic
started and if it was a different job, which industry it was in. We
create two indicator variables to capture the likelihood of working:
doing any market work and working in the same job as the prior round.

The UHFS also asked whether any household member had operated a non-farm
family business since the preceding round, so we also created an
indicator variable where 1 represents operating a business and 0
otherwise. However, Round 1 only asks whether the family has operated a
business since the beginning of 2020 and does not ask about operations
since the start of the lockdown. This means we are unable to use Round 1
information to examine the impact of the lockdown on operating a family
business.

The top three panels of [@fig:work_employment] shows the results for the 
likelihoods of doing market work, operating a non-farm family business, and 
working in the same job as before, using Round 4 as the base.
The bottom two panels show the coefficients for the multinomial logit 
model, relative to non-agriculture work, using Round 0, i.e. pre-COVID-19, 
as the base.

![Changes in work and employment outcomes across survey rounds ---
the top 3 panels show coefficients from linear models with household fixed effects
and dependent indicator variables.
The bottom two panels show coefficients from a fixed effects multinomial logit 
model, relative to non-agricultural work.](../figures/work_employment.pdf){#fig:work_employment}

The likelihood of any market work was significantly lower immediately after
the first lockdown compared to Round 4.
Given the very low number of COVID-19 cases, as shown in [@fig:combined], 
this effect was likely driven predominately by the severe lockdown. 
This is supported by the stated reasons for not working,
which was collected in Round 1;
the top three were that the place of work is closed (62%), 
being ill from any illness or quarantined (10%), 
and being laid off from the job (8%).
Relative to Round 4, there appears to be no medium-run impact of the 
first lockdown, although given the absence of information on pre-Covid
we cannot rule out that the levels of market work were depressed overall.

The medium-run impact of the second lockdown, combined with the 
lower-than-normal rainfall is large, with
the likelihood of market work decreasing by around 13 percentage points. 
This large impact on market work may explain the large impact on food
insecurity in the medium run following the second lockdown.

We cannot estimate the short-run impact of the lockdown on the likelihood 
of operating a non-farm family business, as we do not have data for Round 1.
However, relative to Round 4, the only statistically significantly 
coefficient is for Round 6, where there is an approximately five 
percentage points higher likelihood of operating a non-farm business.
Combined with the positive, but not statistically significant coefficient
for market work in the same round, this suggests that the economy had
slowly started to recover right before the beginning of the second
severe lockdown.

Given the overall decrease in market work, it is useful to understand
whether individuals, who were able to continue work during the lockdowns, 
did so in the same jobs.
The first lockdown significantly was associated with an approximately
10 percentage points lower likelihood of working at the same job, 
relatively to Round 4. 
Thus, we find both a decrease in market work and an increased likelihood 
of moving jobs. 
The impact in the medium run is small, indicating that people remained 
in their new jobs after the end of the lockdown. 

We do not have direct information on wages, but these new jobs likely paid 
less than the pre-lockdown job,
suggesting continued labor market difficulties in the medium run, which
would also affect food insecurity. 
There is only a small, statistically insignificant, effect in the medium 
run following the second lockdown. 
However, we cannot establish whether this is because the second lockdown 
follows the same pattern as the first or because there is less immediate 
movement compared to the first lockdown.


## Movement Between Sectors

With workplace closures during lockdowns and reduced economic activity, 
we expect significant movement between the non-agricultural and the agricultural 
sectors, and between working and not working. 
Enforcement of lockdowns is likely easier in the non-agricultural sector than
the agricultural sector, so we expect that people are more likely to be able
to continue working in the agricultural sector.
Furthermore, those who are laid off may either stop working or resort to 
agricultural production at home, even if the income is lower return than in
their original job. 

To examine this, we create a three-level categorical variable for the household's 
main sector: non-agricultural work (0), agricultural work (1), and not working (2).
We consider a household agricultural if its main activity was related to agriculture,
which includes both farmers, casual farm laborers, and those employed in any 
type of processing, sale, or transport of agricultural goods. 
These households can be either urban or rural.
As we know the household's main industry prior to the first lockdown, we have 
eight rounds of data and use the pre-lockdown round (i.e., Round 0) as the 
excluded round.

\input{../tables/transition_table.tex}

We use a conditional fixed-effects multinomial logit model to estimate 
the movements between agricultural work, non-agricultural work, and not working. 
Standard marginal analyses are not meaningful because the fixed-effects estimator 
cannot make predictions that account for the panel-level fixed effects. 
We, therefore, present the coefficients on the likelihood of working in 
the agricultural sector against working in the non-agricultural sector, 
and the other is the likelihood of not working against working in the 
non-agricultural sector.

The two bottom panels of [@fig:work_employment] show the coefficients
for the multinomial fixed effects logit model on the likelihood of working 
in the agricultural sector and not working, respectively, versus working 
in the non-agricultural sector.
Furthermore, to ease interpretation, Table \ref{tab:transition} shows the transition 
probabilities between the three groups from round to round.[^absolute_groups]

[^absolute_groups]: Appendix @fig:transition_absolute shows the unweighted counts of
household by labor market group.     

There are two important short-run effects of the first lockdown.
First, there was a significant shift to agriculture from working in the 
non-agricultural sector.
Second, there is a significant increase in the risk of not working 
relative to being employed in the non-agricultural sector.
Only just over half of all households working in the non-agricultural 
sector pre-COVID-19 remain in that sector, while 30% are not working and 
15% are working in agriculture in Round 1.
About 7% of the households working in agriculture pre-COVID-19 report
not working in Round 1, likely because the lockdowns also affected
sale and processing of agricultural produce.
Hence, the results suggest that while more people were not working, 
there is also a significant switch to agricultural work to cope with the 
effects of the first lockdown.[^occupation_switch] 

[^occupation_switch]: While not focusing on lockdowns, one prior study 
finds evidence that the pandemic itself led to a switch in
occupations, particularly among salaried and business persons, with
agriculture seeing the biggest inflow of labor compared to other
industries [@Gupta2021].

Although there was some recovery by Round 2, half of those who were 
not working in Round 1 are now working in agriculture, while only 25% 
move (back) to the non-agricultural sector.
Furthermore, relative to pre-COVID-19, households remain substantially 
more likely to be working in agriculture than non-agriculture for the next 
three survey rounds, and only by Round 5, March 2021, is there a reduction 
in the likelihood of working in agriculture, although it comes not from a 
movement to non-agricultural work but rather from not working.

Unfortunately, we cannot see the short-term movement across groups 
after the second lockdown, but the medium-term effect is a reversal
of the very gradual improvement in the likelihood of working in the 
non-agricultural sector that occurred between Round 2 and 6.
This is combined with a substantial movement to not working, mostly
from agriculture, possibly from a combination of the lockdown and
the lower-than-normal rainfall.
The lack of opportunities in the agricultural sector may also explain 
why individuals were likely to remain at the same job after the second 
lockdown (Panel 3). 

The results suggest that the COVID-19 lockdowns had pronounced effects on 
employment dynamics, underscored by the migration from non-agricultural to 
agricultural employment and the significant increases in the likelihood 
of not working.
Although there was a semblance of recovery after the first lockdown, 
the continued high levels of agricultural employment imply a structural 
rather than a transitory adjustment to the employment landscape. 
Furthermore, the resurgence of restrictions interrupted the nascent 
recovery in  non-agricultural employment, showing the precariousness of 
economic revival in the face of additional lockdowns. 
Overall, the results underscore the agricultural sector's role as a vital 
reservoir of employment during periods of economic upheaval, yet also 
highlights its susceptibility to further disruptions, whether policy-driven 
or environmental.


## Income Sources

Households were asked questions related to income in Rounds 1 through 6.
Rather than the monetary value of their income, households were asked
whether their income from different sources increased, remained the
same, decreased, or was completely lost since the prior round (for Round
1, the questions were asked relative to the start date of the lockdown).
The income questions covered five sources: 
(i) family farming, livestock, or fishing, 
(ii) non-farm family business, 
(iii) wage employment, 
(iv) income from assets (properties, investments, or savings), 
and (v) pension.
As the income question was ordinal, we created variables for each income 
source where 1 represents an increase in income, 0 represents income 
remaining unchanged, and -1 represents a decrease in income or a complete loss.

![Impact on the levels of income from farms, non-farm businesses, wages,
and assets  --- coefficients from fixed effects ordered logit model,
with positive representing an increase, 0 no change, and negative 
a decrease](../figures/income_sources.pdf){#fig:income_sources}

Given that we use ordinal variables to represent changes in household
income, we use a conditional fixed-effects ordered logistic model. 
The typical conditional logit model works by applying a fixed-effects logit
model for households that see a change in the dependent variable over time. 
For the conditional *ordered* logit model, the actual values of
the dependent variable are irrelevant. 
Instead, greater values correspond to higher-value outcomes [@Baetschmann2015]. 
Hence, for our regressions, a positive coefficient for lockdowns represents an
increase in household income, a negative coefficient represents a
decrease, and a coefficient near 0 indicates that income remained
stable.
The results are shown in [@fig:income_sources] together with
the number of households that the estimations are based on.[^no-pension]

[^no-pension]: Only 34 households ever reported pension income, so we 
do not show results for this income source.

The first lockdown significantly decreased farm income, non-farm income, and wage income.
Furthermore, the effect on income from assets is negative, although not
statistically significant, likely because of the low number of households who own assets.

The effects persisted in the medium run, with very few
households reporting improvements between Rounds 1 and 2, and,
as a consequence, the estimated effects are either zero or negative.
Only by the third round do a significant number of households
report improvements in income levels.
We do not have income data for Round 7 and thus cannot examine
the medium-term impact of the second lockdown.
These income effects are likely a major reason for the significant increase in
food insecurity from the lockdowns. 


## Outside Assistance

Given the reductions in household income with the lockdowns, we examine
potential coping mechanisms in this section and the next [@Morduch1995; @Townsend1994].

Households may, for example, rely on assistance from family members outside the
household or from institutions. 
In rounds 1 through 6, the UHFS asked households whether they received
assistance from the following sources: (i) remittance from abroad, (ii)
assistance from family members within the country, (iii) assistance from
other non-family individuals, (iv) assistance from NGOs, and (v)
assistance from the government.[^unemployment_benefits] 
The questions were asked the same way as the income questions, where households 
can either report income increase, remaining the same, decrease, or complete 
loss relative to the prior round. 
Therefore, like the income estimations, we create ordinal
variables where 1, 0, and -1 represent an increase, same, and
decrease/complete loss, respectively, and estimate the effect of
lockdowns using the same conditional fixed-effects ordered logistic model.
The results are shown in [@fig:income_assistance].

[^unemployment_benefits]: Households were also asked whether they received unemployment
benefits, but there was only one observation with a change in level,
so we do not have any variation to conduct a conditional ordered
logit estimation.

![Impact on the level of outside assistance --- coefficients from fixed effects ordered 
logit model, with positive representing an increase, 0 no change, and negative 
a decrease](../figures/income_assistance.pdf){#fig:income_assistance}

We find no statistically significant effect on the assistance from 
family with the country, assistance from non-family individuals,
or remittances after the first lockdown. 
The first two fell slightly, while the level of remittances increased slightly.
This statistically insignificant increase for remittances does run counter to 
the substantial decline in remittances across the world in the second quarter of 2020, 
as lockdowns worldwide led to the closure of workplaces and limited people's 
movements  [@Cardozo-Silva2022; @Guha2021; @Kpodar2021; @Shimizutani2021; @Zhang2021]. 
However, only 63 households reported any change over the six survey rounds.

Neither could the households turn to NGOs or the government for help.
Only 15 households report any change in NGO assistance, while only 26 
households report a change in government assistance.
Not surprisingly, both coefficients are very noisy for the first and
second rounds.

These results suggest that households' standard coping mechanisms were 
unavailable during the lockdowns. 
The failure of these coping
mechanisms in the face of reductions in income likely contributed
substantially to the large effects of lockdowns on food insecurity.



## Other Changes to the Household


As households faced greater food insecurity during lockdowns, it is possible 
that, on the one hand, some household members left to look for better opportunities.
On the other hand, lockdowns resulted in decreased income and diminished work 
opportunities, and schools were closed throughout the entire period.
Consequently, migrants may have chosen to return to their families, 
and students attending boarding schools---particularly common in secondary 
education---also likely returned home, and these returns 
may further increase food insecurity.[^school_lunch]

[^school_lunch]: Children at local schools would also spend more time 
at home more as a result of the school closures.
Although we cannot directly capture this dimension, it is likely that
it added to the general level of food insecurity as these children
often would have been served lunch at school, as was the case for 
Nigeria [@Abay2021].


Using the household rosters from UHFS and the UNPS 2019/20, we have data
on the number of household members, adults, and children, and location of
the households for the last UNPS survey before COVID-19, here referred to as Round 0, 
and for each survey round. 
One caveat is that UNPS 2019/20 data collection took place between 
April 2019 and February 2020, which means that the pre-COVID-19 information on 
household size can be more than a year for the first UHFS survey.
The top three panels of [@fig:members_location] show the impact of lockdowns 
on the number of household members and on the number of adults and children separately.

![Impact on the number of household members and the likelihood of urban 
locations --- household fixed effects coefficients from linear models 
with continuous outcome variables for the top three panels and an indicator 
variable for the bottom 
panel.](../figures/household_composition_and_urban_location.pdf){#fig:members_location}

Relatively to before COVID-19, the number of household members is
statistically significantly higher throughout the entire period.
This effect comes almost entirely from an increase in the number of children. 
The exception is for Round 7, where there are statistically significant
increases in both the number of adults and the number of children,
relatively to before COVID-19.
The continuous increase in the number of children until Round 4 
compared to the pre-COVID-19 survey, suggests that this change is not 
driven by the lockdowns and school closures, which began at the same time
as the first lockdown and did not end until 2022.


Hence, although the school closures may have increased the base level of 
food insecurity compared to before COVID-19, it is unlikely 
to have driven the increases in food insecurity during the first lockdowns.

The relative reduction in household size in Round 6 may be related to
the improvement of the labor market suggested above with older children 
moving to jobs. 
However, similarly to the likelihood of market work, the second lockdown 
reversed the positive trend, substantially increasing the number of both 
adult and young household members. 

Related to migration, we find no such evidence of lockdown-induced 
migration in the bottom panel of [@fig:members_location], which
shows the likelihood of living in an urban area.

Lastly, given the shift to agricultural work, we examine whether
agricultural households change their agricultural strategy to cope with
the lockdowns. 
We find suggestive evidence that agricultural households
changed their farming strategy during the lockdowns, such as changing
the farming area and changes in the variety of crops produced. 
The details of these results are in the Appendix.

Overall, our results indicate that the households, on average, could 
not take advantage of outside help,
whether it was assistance from family members living outside of the
household or assistance from institutions. 
We do find evidence of a switch to agricultural work.

## Agricultural vs. Non-Agricultural Households

Given the increase in agricultural work with the first lockdown, 
[@fig:ag_vs_non_ag] examines whether agricultural households fared 
better than non-agricultural households. 
We show the results for two different approaches.
First, the two left columns separate households by whether they 
were agricultural households before COVID-19 and estimate each level 
of food insecurity.[^agri_pre_covid] 
Second, the results in the right two columns come from one regression 
per level of food insecurity and use the prior rounds' 
reported agricultural status interacted with the survey indicators.
Note, as we previously treated households' work in agriculture 
as a choice variable, this set of estimations is exploratory rather than causal. 
In all cases, the effects are shown relative to survey Round 4 as above.

[^agri_pre_covid]: Round 1 of the survey asks about the household's
area of work before the lockdown, which allows us to identify whether households
were in agriculture before the first lockdown.
    
![Estimated changes in food insecurity with 95% confidence intervals

Left two columns condition on pre-COVID-19 agricultural status, while the 
right two columns allow households to change status](../figures/agri_vs_non_agri.pdf){#fig:ag_vs_non_ag}   

Agricultural households' food security appeared change less than
non-agricultural households' food security during the first lockdown. 
Their likelihood of suffering "any food insecurity" during lockdowns,
relative to Round 4, was about 20 percentage points lower than non-agricultural 
households, as shown by Round 1.
In fact, there are no statistically significant differences between Rounds 1
and 4 for agricultural households, whether we use pre-COVID-19 or prior survey
agricultural status.
Agricultural households also do better than non-agricultural households
when it comes to both moderate/severe or severe food insecurity, although
the difference is less stark for these outcomes.
Specifically, for severe food insecurity, the estimated difference between
Round 1 and 4 is very close to zero.

However, for Round 7, there is little difference across different 
measures of food insecurity, with all groups seeing statistically 
significant increases in food insecurity.
This suggests that the concurrent lower-than-normal rainfall
removed some of the protection from lockdowns that 
agricultural households had previously had.


# Conclusion

As countries around the world continue to navigate the challenges posed by 
the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and plan for responses to potential 
future crises and epidemics, 
understanding the cost and benefits of potential policies is critical.
Using country-wide panel data with a household fixed-effects model, we
examine the impact of the two COVID-19 lockdowns in Uganda on food insecurity
and household responses.
As we use the periods during COVID-19 with fewer restrictions as the comparison,
we expect our results to be lower-bound estimates.
 
Food insecurity increased substantially during the first lockdown. 
The first lockdown also had a significant medium-run impact
on food insecurity. 
The medium-run impact was even more pronounced following the second lockdown.
The larger effect is likely partly from the compounding effect of the 
concurrent environmental stressors of a lower-than-normal rainfall,
especially in the Western region of Uganda,
and partly from reduced resilience after the effects of the first lockdown.

The lockdowns led to significant disruptions in income sources across the board, 
with decreases in income from agriculture, non-farm businesses, and wage employment 
contributing to the rise in food insecurity.
Both agricultural and non-agricultural households were affected, although
non-agricultural households experienced more severe impacts. 
This difference underscores the relative resilience of agricultural activities 
during lockdown periods.
Agriculture provided a coping mechanism for many households, and 
the switch towards agricultural work suggests a strategic shift in 
employment patterns in response to the lockdown measures. 

However, traditional sources of coping mechanisms, such as reliance on 
outside assistance from family members and friends, NGOs, or government support, 
proved inadequate during the lockdowns, leaving households to face 
the economic shocks with limited external support.
Remittance from abroad, assistance from family members within the country, assistance
from non-family individuals, and assistance from development organizations, 
were all either flat or decreased during the lockdowns. 
This lack of assistance may explain lockdowns' substantial effect on food insecurity.

Three broader conclusions emerge from our results. 
First, on average, agriculture is likely less productive than non-farm 
work but more productive than not working. 
Hence, with the slow rate of switching back from agriculture that we observe, 
the lockdowns can potentially have severe long-term adverse effects on Uganda's development.
 
Second, the results show the limits of self-insurance and mutual 
insurance when faced with a systemic shock.
Most of the literature has focused on the smaller and more frequent risk
of idiosyncratic shocks and how households respond to these. 
However, a better understanding of systemic shocks and how households respond is
still lacking. 

Finally, the case of Uganda illustrates well the issues with the wholesale 
lockdown of economies in response to COVID-19,
particularly in situations with low state capacity. 
Uganda has been hailed as a leading example of curbing COVID-19 [@Adams2021]. 
However, the mitigation efforts failed to reach those most affected by the lockdown.
With the low mortality rate in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Uganda, the
long-term cost of the lockdowns likely significantly outweighs the benefits.
In addition to the increasing food insecurity and decline in economic activity, 
the lockdowns disrupted education and reduced accessibility 
and use of health care with the lockdowns in Uganda.[^other_effects] 
Quantifying all these costs and identifying possible
avenues of mitigation are critical future areas of research.

[^other_effects]: See @Bose2023 on health care and @Batte2021 for an early assessment 
of the effects on education on a small sample.

# Change in Agricultural Strategy

In this section, we examine whether agricultural households change their
agricultural strategy to better cope with the effects of the lockdowns.
The survey asked in Rounds 1, 4, and 7 to households engaged in planting
activities whether they changed their "planting activities in the
current agricultural season because of changes in the country or
community due to coronavirus?". 
During the first lockdown, 23.2 percent of agricultural households
reported changing their planting activities because of the pandemic,
as did 18.5 percent during the second lockdown.
This is as opposed to 5 percent for the non-lockdown period of Round 4.

We create an indicator variable where 1 represents a change in planting
activities, and 0 represents no change. 
We present the estimates of the impact of lockdowns on changes in planting 
activities in [@fig:ag_plant_change]. 
The estimates show that the first lockdown led to a 57 percentage points 
increase in the likelihood of changing crop planting activities, and the 
second lockdown led to a 26 percentage points increase compared to Round 4.

For households with a change in activities, the survey also asked them
how they changed their activities. This allows us to shed more light on
how agricultural households attempted to change their farming strategy
to cope with the effect of the shock. 
Table \ref{tab:ag_changes} shows that the biggest change was a change in the 
use of farm areas, where 8.7 percent reported
a reduction, and 9 percent reported an increase in the use of farm
areas after the first lockdown. 
It is followed by changes in the number
of varieties of crops produced, where both an increase (4.1%) and a
decrease (2.6%) in variety are mentioned after the first lockdown. 
Only a small fraction of farmers delayed planting (1.3%) or abandoned crop
farming (1.5%) altogether for that season after the first lockdown.
