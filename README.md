# Effects of Uganda's Covid Lockdown

**Purpose:**

Two main research question: 
1) How did lockdown affect food insecurity in Uganda?
2) How did households cope with the lockdown? Did they change their agricultural strategy? Did they receive more remittance? Did they receive more govt. assistance? Was there more migration? 

Sub-questions:
i) Who mostly suffered the insecurity, agricultural households or non-ag households?
ii) Was the increased insecurity caused by a reduction in income? Or reduced production of food by agricultural households?
iii) How specifically was income affected? In other words, was it because of unemployment, or reduction in self-employment income or changes in agriculture?
iv) how were agricultural practices affected? Did they not grow crop because of covid? How did covid pose specific challenge to their ag production? How did they change crop planting strategies? ag revenue higher or lower?
v) How did shocks, in the presence of covid, affect behavior? 


## Directory structure

You need the following directories for the code to run:

- raw_data: original data files.
- code: data cleaning, variables, and analysis
- data: derived data files and results
- figures: generated figures and other figures for paper
- tables: generated tables

In addition, the following directories has writing in them:

- paper: the paper itself, together with snippets and notes
- presentations: various presentations, each its own tex file
- submission: files for submission and referee report
- response: response to referee and editors' reports
- latex: final version in LaTeX for submission for copy editing

## Data 

Data are from the Uganda High-Frequency Phone Survey on COVID-19 2020-2021

All data are freely available from the World Bank's micro-data website:
[https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3765/](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3765/).
Notice, this requires registration with a brief description of the
intended use of the data.

For the code to run, download the data in Stata format from
[https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3765/get-microdata](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3765/get-microdata).

Furthermore, the paper uses some data from Uganda National Panel Survey 2019-2020,
which can be found at https://doi.org/10.48529/nqzx-f196.

Each round and the UNPS rounds should be separate directories:

```
./raw_data
|-- external_data
|-- round1
|-- round2
|-- round3
|-- round4
|-- round5
|-- round6
|-- round7
|-- panel_15_16
|-- panel_18_19
|-- panel_19_20
```

More information is available in the `README.md` in the `raw_data` directory.

The documentation for the individual rounds is available at:
[https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3765/related-materials](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3765/related-materials)



##  Generating files

All data wrangling and analyses are done in R.
However, some of the analyses in `10_response.R` call Stata through the 
`RStata` package, so you will need Stata installed.
Note, the Stata path is set for a Mac, with Stata-MP 18, so you might need to 
change the path in the `10_response.R` file.

Speaking of packages, the project uses `renv`. 
If all goes according to plan, you should be able to just 
run `renv::restore()` and all packages should be installed.
If not, check out possible solutions at [https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html).

All figures, tables, and pdfs can be generated by running `make view` in a 
terminal (make sure you are in the base directory of the project first).
If you want only a specific file use `make <fileName>`.
See the "Makefile" in the base directory for more information 
on what files are included and the PDF viewer.
