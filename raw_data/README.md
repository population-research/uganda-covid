# Raw data

See main `README.md` for data access.
Each round should be a separate directory:

```
./raw_data
|-- round1
|-- round2
|-- round3
|-- round4
|-- round5
|-- round6
|-- round7
|-- panel_19_20
```

The `panel_19_20` contains the 2019/20 panel data with the following
directories `Agric`, `Community`, `HH`, `Woman`, and the file `pov2019_20.dta`.
These can be added by simply transferring the unzipped files from the
World Bank data.
